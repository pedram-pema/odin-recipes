# odin-recipes
## Project description
This is my first project on TOP. In this project I'm going to build a simple recipe website, only using HTML.
The goal of this project is to test my learnings about HTML Foundations. This section is a part of Foundations Course on The Odin Project.
It's not only to practice HTML, but I'm I'll be practicing my Git skills too.
